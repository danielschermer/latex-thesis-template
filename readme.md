# Latex Thesis Template
This is the $\LaTeX$ template which I used for writing my cumulative PhD thesis.
It was created based on the `scrbook` document class and by studying the wonderful [KOMA-Script](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) documentation. My main goal was to:
* achieve a visually-pleasing two-sided layout with a title page that adheres to the requirements of the [University of Kaiserslautern-Landau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kaiserslautern-Landau),
* include the abstract of each paper at the beginning of each corresponding chapter,
* use `biber` for creating a separate subbibliography in each chapter, apart from having the standard bibliography at the end,
* create and use consistent abbreviations throughout the thesis by means of the `glossary` package.

Compiles by calling `pdflatex` and `biber`! :rocket:
